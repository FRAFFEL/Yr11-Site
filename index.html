										The Deep Web is what you can’t directly access on the internet by tradition means

										and private information from government information, medical records to anonymous 
										forums and drug deals.</p>

									<p><strong>Dark Web</strong><br />
										The Dark web is a part of the Deep Web that is made of small peer-to-peer networks 
										but also has a few larger networks such as Tor and Freenet. They can allow anonymous 
										website hosting. This anonymity means these websites can be used for illegal activities. <em>- James S.</em></p>

							<h2>Drugs on the Dark Web  </h2>
						</header>
						<p>Illicit and Prescription drugs is the biggest category within the dark web. Approximately 15.4% of all 
							hidden services (dark web/ deep web websites/ online services) are drug related. The most notorious 
							illicit drug website is called the Silk Road. This website is based on the transportation and 
							smuggling of drugs to people who order them. Websites like these use a cryptocurrency called 
							Bitcoin. Drugs are able to reach across the globe sometimes spanning all the way around the 
							globe to meet its final destination. Obviously, the further these substances are sent the higher 
							the risk of authorities seizing the substances. The Silk Road, and many other websites transporting 
							and selling illegal and prescription drugs take advantage of the postage service and system, hiding 
							these dangerous substances from chocolate bars to other miscellaneous items to pass through countries 
							postage security measures to reach the anonymous customer.<em>- Jaike R.</em></p>

							<h2>What Are Authorities are Doing</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The governments of countries such as the United States of America and Australia are working towards bringing 
							down websites containing illegal markets that are selling and purchasing illicit goods and performing illegal 
							services (such as hacking, hitmen, selling of drugs etc.). The FBI shut down an infamous drug trading website 
							by the name of the Silk Road in October 2013, however the website still to this day remains online by bringing 
							the website up whenever it goes down. When drugs are posted authorities are able to search suspicious packages 
							that may contain illegal items and are sometimes able to intervene a drug trade, then the drugs are destroyed. 
							Enforcement bodies (such as the Police and FBI etc.) are able to find people purchasing drugs online as well as 
							selling drugs on the dark web. These enforcement bodies then arrest the accused person and search their computers 
							and other devices, as well as their home if suspected of selling or purchasing illicit substances.<em>- Jaike R.</em></p>

							<h2>The Use of Bitcoin on the Dark Web</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The use of Bitcoin within the dark web is huge. Bitcoin is the main form of currency for the dark web, just like how 
							Australia has the AU dollar, the dark web has Bitcoin. This form of currency is called a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency 
							is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques and are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and 
							verify the transfer of funds, usually operating independently of a central bank. Bitcoin has no original founder or bank 
							and relies on their users to keep the currency afloat. The currency changes in price and is at its highest point of all time. 
							One bitcoin costs on average $7,657 as of May 2018 and the highest price it has gotten to was around $17,549 as of December 
							2017. This means that for people to purchase products or services people have to use for example .005 of a bitcoin is $48.64 AUD, 
							this means if Bitcoin were to change the amount of Bitcoin’s needed to purchase a good or service would increase or decrease 
							depending on the statistics at that time.<em>- Jaike R.</em></p>

							<h2>Firearms on the Dark Web</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The illegal trade of firearms and explosives on the dark web allows no regulation and lets users bypass requirements for owning what 
							they are buying. The firearms brought are smuggled to its customer illegally through border control. 60% of firearms on the dark web 
							originated in the US. With the dark web more recent and advanced firearms can be bought and smuggled. Gangs and small terrorist 
							cells that have the money can easily buy high grade assault firearms and explosives. firearms on the Dark web are harder to 
							trace as they have their serial numbers removed.<br />      
								- Common firearms bought on on the Dark web are:<br />
								- Glock<br />
								- Beretta<br />
								- Uzi<br />
								- Highpoint<br />
								- Walther<br />
								These automatic firearms can easily be concealed and pack quite a punch.

							<h2>Dark Web Hackers</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hacking Services are highly sought after in the Dark Web. Hackers on the deep web can be hired to conduct a realistic penetration test or alternatively they can be hired to take control of a Gmail or Facebook account, most likely for cyber espionage. According to Business Insider it will cost $90 to hack into a Gmail account, whereas it will cost $350 to hack into someone’s Facebook account. Hackers can also attack a person’s Netflix account for only $1.25.
								There are other Hacking services available in the deep web, for example, you are able to take hacking courses for $20, it is also possible to ask for a hit and run attack, and for example a DDoS attack or you can request website defacement.
								The majority of hackers on the Deep Web are a part of a community which are closed to the public, and to enter you must request an invitation to join these hacking groups in discussion. In many cases these groups are specialized in their activities, as they target specific topics and or practices, which for example can include Social media hacking or data theft. <em>- Flynn G.</em></p>

							<h2>How Tor Works</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Tor is a series of networks used to browse the dark web. Tor does not directly connect the client to the 
							server but pings the client between multiple server around the world to ensure anonymity. For example a
							 user from Australian when using Tor may have their connection routed through America, Europe and then 
							 Asia to be connected to the server they wish. This is why the Tor logo is a onion as it has many layers.
